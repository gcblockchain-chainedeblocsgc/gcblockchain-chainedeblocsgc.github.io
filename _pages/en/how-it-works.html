      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <h3>Key Dates</h3>
      <p>The kick-off is Tuesday, April 17th, 2018 as part of the quarterly Government of Canada Blockchain Working Group meeting. All registrants will be forwarded an email invitation to attend the kick-off as a virtual participant using a teleconference and WebEx.</p>
      <p>The deadline for solution submissions is Monday, April 23rd at 9:00am EST</p>
      <h3>Team Formation</h3>
      <p>The GC Blockchain Codefest is open to everyone, including the federal, provincial/territorial public service as well as students and teachers from universities and colleges in Canada. Individuals that do not have a team are encouraged to register as a participant for the location of their choice and their registration details will be forwarded to the event organizer for follow-up.</p>
      <p>The GC Blockchain Codefest is not just for people who code; a diversity of skills, experience and ideas, contributing to a unified cause, will results in richer and more diverse outcomes.</p>
      <h3>Themes</h3>
      <p>Teams will select one theme from the provided list of public sector use cases that are listed in the Use Cases and Themes section of this page.</p>
      <p>A team may contact TBS and propose an alternative public sector use case. However, TBS will require the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The proposed theme must represent providing a benefit to the public sector and/or the people served by the public sector</li>
        <li>The team must submit the theme description to the Slack Channel so that everyone sees it</li>
        <li>The team does not try to use the proposed theme as an opportunity to purely upsell or promote a specific company or service. TBS will not showcase the submission if it is an attempt at self-promotion.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Submissions</h3>
      <p>Submissions that fail to address a public sector need or opportunity will be rejected.</p>
      <p>The GC Blockchain Day event on April 23rd will be a showcase of all of the approved submissions</p>
      <h3>Locations</h3>
      <p>The primary codefest will occur in Ottawa at the Microsoft headquarters during the week of April 16th and confirmed satellite codefest locations will occur in Calgary, Montreal, Toronto, St. Johnâ€™s, Seattle, Johannesburg, Accra and Cyberjaya.</p>
      <p>Each location will have a separate EventBrite ticket to help the local organizers manage their attendees.</p>
      <p>Each satellite location will adhere to the provided guidelines from TBS and they will independently operate their own codefest based upon the availability of a location and participants.</p>
      <h3>Collaboration tools</h3>
      <p>Slack, Twitter, GitHub, YouTube and WebEx will be used to manage the communication from the 17th - 23rd.</p>
      <p>The following common Slack channels will be available:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>#general</b>: Questions & Answers</li>
        <li><b>#faq</b>: Frequently Asked Questions</li>
        <li><b>#sharing</b>: Sharing of best practices and resources</li>
      </ul>
      <p>1-2 follow-up meetings will be setup with all of the satellite location participants via WebEx.</p>
      <p>The social tag is #GCBlockchainDay</p>
      <h3>Register</h3>
