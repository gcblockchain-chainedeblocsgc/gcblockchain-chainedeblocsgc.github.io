<h1>GCentities</h1>

<p>GCentities is a proposed project to share a central database of information on all Government of Canada entities (all departments, agencies, and crown corporations from 1867 to the present) between GC departments and with the public (on an Open Government portal). Motivation: currently, many GC entities spend FTE resources maintaining their own databases for their specific mandate activities, but in almost all cases the basic information could be created and updated from a single central source (such as PCO or TBS) and distributed to the departments. Issues to resolve are the appropriate platform, interface, editing permissions, and security levels (since some departments may use the database for classified/protected activities).</p>
