    <h1>Electronic Health Record</h1>
    <p>EHRs are real-time, patient-centered records that make information available instantly and securely to authorized users. While an EHR does contain the medical and treatment histories of patients, an EHR system is built to go beyond standard clinical data collected in a provider’s office and can be inclusive of a broader view of a patient’s care.</p>
    <p>EHRs are built to share information with other health care providers and organizations – such as laboratories, specialists, medical imaging facilities, pharmacies, emergency facilities, and school and workplace clinics – so they contain information from all clinicians involved in a patient’s care.</p>
    <p>With this tool we seek to improve the quality of care, patient safety and communication among the actors of the system.</p>
    <p>Some of its main benefits:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Improve access to information,</li>
      <li>Standardized data entry,</li>
      <li>Warning systems in case of contraindications, interactions or overdoses,</li>
      <li>Clinical decision support systems,</li>
      <li>Facilitate the unique story,</li>
      <li>Facilitate scientific and statistical work,</li>
      <li>Automate and streamline provider workflow</li>
      <li>Secure data record and sharing,</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Goal</h2>
    <p>Develop a system that allows to record in a secure and permanent way all the information of a patient, which may come from different sources and formats, increasing the security, privacy, and interoperability of health data. Blockchain could be an interesting technology to achieve this goal, but his potential for healthcare depends on how willing healthcare organizations are to create the required technical infrastructure.</p>
