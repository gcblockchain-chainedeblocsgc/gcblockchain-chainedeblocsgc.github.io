<h1>Blockchain Notary</h1>
<p>One common used service for sensitive documents it's the need of time-stamp and proof of ownership without assistance. A system than can file a document and have a time-linked historical reference to it can be a solution for this need without human intervention. Document can include government forms, a commercial contract, a region-marked photograph or piece of artwork. Primary benefit is that documents are backed on the blockchain in perpetuity. This means that the documentâ€™s footprint exists in cyberspace even if the physical copy vanishes.</p>

<h2>The Goal</h2>
<p>Develop a web system to upload a document of a max given size and have a receipt of the proof of this act. A time-stamp and a hash (cryptographic representation of the document) must be included.</p>
<p>The system will also provide a way to prove that the file has been notarized or not. This solution must be designed / implemented using Blockchain Technology thats not include this function as part of it's own services.</p>
