<h1>Seamless Service Delivery</h1>

<h2>Challenge Statement </h2>
<p>In today’s digital world, businesses and innovators are regularly managing interactions with governments at all levels (federal, provincial, territorial, municipal, and international). Businesses may have grants, tax, corporate filings and permits to manage. For example, a business may, through a variety of online interactions, be searching and applying for grants every quarter, maintaining incorporation fees every year and filing for permits for new initiatives on an as needed basis. Each of these interactions typically occurs between the business and a number of government services such as Federal Incorporations, Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), Clean Growth Hub (CGH), provincial permits and licenses, and Canada Revenue Agency (CRA), each with their own timelines and processes. </p>
<p>With a number of services requiring a variety of information about a business to be provided over and over again, the challenge is to provide businesses with a seamless service experience by leveraging blockchain technology to provide businesses with government service visibility and traceability across all levels while still ensuring the privacy of the business’ information and interactions. </p>
<p><strong>Each service provider currently uses a variety of systems to provide its services. Unfortunately many that are not integrated require businesses to navigate different applications or websites to check the status of their application or filing. Can blockchain technology be leveraged to allow businesses to provide digitally verifiable proofs about their government- issued qualifications and associated information when transacting online? As such, a business owns this proof-of-status and associated information and can use it with any other government online transactions that require it.</strong></p>

<h2>Sample Scenario </h2>
<p>Hackathon Inc. has merged with Coca-Cola Inc. <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=2135345&amp;V_TOKEN=1522251086512&amp;crpNm=coca%20cola&amp;crpNmbr=&amp;bsNmbr=">213534-5</a>. As a result, Mr. Hack Athon wants to be added as a director to Coca Cola Inc., and wants Corporations Canada’s <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cd-dgc.nsf/vwapj/FRM-6-e.pdf/$file/FRM-6-e.pdf">FORM 6</a> Section 3 to be pre-populated with information (i.e. first name, last name, address) already entered into his <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/registration-inscription/home.html?bpss">ISED account</a> (User Name: “hackathon”; Password: “Hackath0n”) in a way that preserves a record of the transaction and does not show any of the information to the user, in case Mr. Athon’s account has been hacked. </p>

<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>To ensure that businesses flourish and receive optimal benefits from government services at all levels, this solution will provide users with a more seamless experience, where users only have to enter their information once and transactions records are secure, transparent, and immutable. This shift towards decentralization enables greater participation, increased transparency and the ability to maintain trust and integrity of data.</p>
